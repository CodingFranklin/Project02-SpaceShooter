# Project Name
Space Shooter 2025/2/16
Description: This project is an exercise in using unity and especially visual scripting.
## Implementation - List Everything you did for extra points!
A ship that is controlled by the player that can fire a weapon
Two kinds of enemies and one kind of asteroid. The enemy will either move through sin(x) or like a circle
There is a scoring system, start-game menu, and end-game screen

I used an extra asset that contains lots of different lasers. And by these assets, I implemented another game mechanic. By defeating the enemies (not the asteroid), they will drop a thing called energy. And the player can pick it up by moving close to it. Every energy will charge 25 laser energy, at most 100. The player can shoot a powerful laser by pushing the left shift button and it will cost 50 energy. The powerful laser will destroy every enemy that it collides with. In order to make players easier to see how much energy they have, I have also added an energy bar on the bottom-right corner.
I have added an in-game pause menu. It contains three buttons. Resume, Restart, and Quit.
I have also added some background images for different scenes.
The player's weapon is also a little bit different. Instead of small squares, I tried to use missiles that would initially have low velocity but accelerate very fast. It will destroy in 5 seconds.
I also added the asteroid spawner and enemy spawner in order to have a constant playing experience.
